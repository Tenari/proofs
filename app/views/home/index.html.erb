<h1>Welcome to Proofs</h1>
<div class="page-container home">
  <p>The purpose of this site is to encourage structured logical argument. We've all seen flamewars and endless comment threads. While I have no doubt that some of that will live here, the site tries to discourage it in a structured way by enforcing limits on who can respond, where, and how much space you are given.</p>
  <p>Here, we make distinctions between types of statements. These are the important ones:</p>
  <ul>
    <li class="definition">Theorem: a purportedly true statement that can be supported or assumed. 200 characters or less.</li>
    <li class="definition">Argument: a series of theorems which supports a conclusion (which is itself a theorem). Can be an ordered chain of reasoning or a list of unconnected supporting theorems.</li>
    <li class="definition">Objection: a theorem which refutes a previous theorem. Can be attached to any theorem in an argument.</li>
    <li class="definition">Comment: a potentially sprawling blob of text which is attached to a theorem (or an objection).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Confused? It's easier to see it in action: <a href="/theorems">Get started</a> by looking at some of our more popular theorems.</p>
