# Bugs

- it can be hard to find a theorem someone else made

# Ideas

- a way to detect duplicate Theorems and just use previously existing one.
- another way to login
- intelligent sorting
- comments/discussion with no limits below the actual arguments.
- contraversiality metric
- universality metric
- different voting systems: popular, quality
    - quality is based on how 'intelligent' the voters are. so it's just a weighted voting system
