# Bugs

- it can be hard to find a theorem someone else made
- timestamps look bad
- expand-block max-height + pagination?

# Ideas

- a way to detect duplicate Theorems and just use previously existing one.
- another way to login
- intelligent sorting
- contraversiality metric
- universality metric
- different voting systems: popular, quality
    - quality is based on how 'intelligent' the voters are. so it's just a weighted voting system
- need way to submit arguments to another user's theorem. An argument pull-request.
- need user profile to show all a user's root theorems + activity stream.
